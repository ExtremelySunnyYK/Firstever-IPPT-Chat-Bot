<h3>This workout plan would boost your pushup numbers per minute by 50 - 75 %<h3>

<h3>On Odd Days<h3>
<p>Do 100 pushups in as few sets as possible, doing maximum repetiton in each sets. You can still do upper body workouts or in addition to your cardio.<p>

'<b>On Even Days<b>\n\n
Do 100 pushups throughout the day. This can be little sets of ten done every half hour or fifty pushups done four times throughout the day.\n\n


Repeat the ODD/EVEN routine for a total of 10 days. Then take three days off and do NO upper body pushing exercises that work the chest, triceps, and shoulders. Then on day 14, give yourself the pushup test. I would not recommend this workout more than once every six months, since it rather challenging on the same muscle groups repeatedly.'


There are three main types of pushups you can do to break up the monotony: "regular" pushups, "wide" pushups, and triceps pushups.
