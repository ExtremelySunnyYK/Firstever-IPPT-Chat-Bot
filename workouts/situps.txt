<b>Situp 14 day Boost Plan</b>\n\n


<b>Day 1–4</b>: \n\n  
Do {} situps in thirty second paced sets.\n Aim for 20–25 situps in 30 seconds.\n So for this workout, you will do roughly 8–9 sets of 20–25 situps in 30 seconds.\n\n

After that, end it with 3 sets of 30 sec planks.\n\n


<b>Day 5–8</b>:\n\n You change the timed sets and shoot for 40–50 situps in 1 minute sets.  Do {} situps in 1 minute sets with a goal of 40–50 situps per minute.  This should take you 4–5 sets done through your workout for four days straight.

After that, end it with 3 sets of 1 min plank.\n\n

<b>Days 11–13</b>: \n\n  Time to recover – Take 3 days off from any abdominal exercises.  You can exercise,but skip the ab exercises for this 3 days.

Day 14:  TEST Day – Give yourself a mock test and focus on the goal pace you mastered.  When you do your situps, practice exerting on the UP movement of the situp and letting gravity take you back to the ground. Just fall back – relaxing the abs for a second.

Spread these 30s/1min sets throughout your existing workout however you desire.\n 
I personally like to "rest with abs" in between sets of pullups or weighted exercises or even running / swimming intervals.

* Note if you are having trouble keeping the goal pace for 30 seconds, try it for 15 seconds and shoot for quick timed sets of 10–12 repetitions for 15 seconds.  The first 15–20 seconds of a 2 minute situp test is where people start off too fast, so it is a good idea to practice the start of the test regularly.
